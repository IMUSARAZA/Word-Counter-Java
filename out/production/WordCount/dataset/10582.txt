INTRODUCTION


Meals of many courses are neither practical nor popular with the modern
hostess. For a company luncheon or supper it is not necessary to serve
more than a hot dish, a salad, a biscuit or sandwich, a dessert and a
beverage. A first course and a relish may be provided if desired.


SUNDAY NIGHT SUPPERS

The following menus were arranged especially as Sunday night suppers,
but they are equally suitable for midday luncheons or high teas. Many of
the dishes will be found desirable for afternoon teas or evening
spreads, and for use in tea and lunch rooms, and for automobile picnics.


PRELIMINARY PREPARATIONS

Preparations for Sunday night suppers should be made on Saturday as far
as possible. For a luncheon it is a help to have some things done the
day before. For picnics and parties much must be done in advance. As an
aid to the hostess we have listed after each menu what these preliminary
preparations may be.


COOKING AT THE TABLE

Many of the hot dishes may be prepared in a chafing dish or on an
electric grill. For these, much of the measuring may be done in advance,
the ingredients being put in small dishes on a tray. Coffee and tea may
be made at the table with electric appliances.


SANDWICHES AND BISCUITS

Sandwiches may be made and wrapped first in dry cheesecloth, then in
damp cheesecloth, and placed in a covered crock some hours before a
meal. The hot biscuits may be replaced by rolls or bread and butter if
desired.


AUTOMOBILE PICNICS

For picnics the beverages and hot dishes may be prepared at home and
carried in thermos food jars. The cold dishes may be packed in a small
portable refrigerator. The biscuits, sandwiches, cakes, and cookies
should be carefully wrapped in wax paper and packed in boxes. Ice creams
may be taken in the freezer. Hot sandwiches and bacon may be cooked over
the coals or on a portable oil or alcohol stove. In some menus it may be
desirable to omit or modify a few of the dishes, if food is to be
carried several miles.


MARKET ORDERS

Supplies for use on Sunday evening should, of course, be purchased on
Saturday. To prevent any mistakes in ordering we have listed under each
menu the foodstuffs that will be required. Supplies that are usually
kept on hand are not listed, as

  Baking powder
  Cayenne
  Cornstarch
  Bread flour
  Pastry flour
  Molasses
  Mustard
  Paprika
  Pepper
  Rock salt
  Table salt
  Granulated sugar
  Soda
  Spices, whole and ground
  Table sauce
  Vanilla
  Vinegar




HOW TO BUY

Some things are listed in the market orders that many people always have
on hand. This is for the benefit of those who do not prepare all their
meals and have little space for seldom used supplies. As far as feasible
the amounts of material in the market orders are such as could be
purchased. They may differ somewhat from the amounts called for in the
recipes, thus leaving some foodstuff on hand. In many cases it may be
more economical to purchase in larger quantities than those given. In
some cases smaller amounts are called for than can be purchased, as
one-half can, or one-fourth cup, in case supplies on hand are adequate
without purchasing more than required. Butter only is given in the
market orders. In cooking, margarine, lard, and other shortenings may be
used instead, if preferred.




MEASUREMENTS

In all recipes measurements are made level. Measuring cups, divided into
thirds and quarters, are used, and tea and table measuring spoons. Cups
of dry material are filled to overflowing by putting the material into
the cup with a tablespoon, and are then leveled off with a knife. Tea
and tablespoons are filled heaping with dry material, and then leveled
off with a knife. Flour should be sifted once before measuring.




RECIPES AND MENUS

The recipes are planned to serve eight persons. Most of them may be
divided for a smaller party.

The average cost of the menus is fifty cents per person. Some of the
dishes may be made less expensive and rich by substituting milk for
cream, and by other substitutions and omissions that will suggest
themselves to the resourceful hostess. Many types of dishes are given.
Many variations are possible.

In some menus a choice of dishes is suggested. A few recipes are given
that are not called for in the menus. These are usually to show how to
utilize in a different way something for which a recipe is given or to
use in another meal some foodstuff left from a recipe.

These recipes and menus have all been tested at Miss Farmer's School of
Cookery. The author wishes to express here her appreciation of the
painstaking work of all the members of the staff of the school who have
assisted in making this little book possible.

BOSTON, MASS., August, 1922.

Ham prepared for the sandwiches
Tomatoes peeled and placed in ice box
Salad dressing made
Fig marguerites made
Candied mint leaves prepared
Ice cream ready to freeze
Jelly made



MARKET ORDER

1 pound cooked ham
1 cream cheese (Roquefort flavor if desired)
1 quart milk
1 pint cream
1/2 pound butter
6 eggs
1/2 pound white grapes
3 or 4 oranges
2 lemons

1/8 pound cocoa
1 loaf sandwich bread
1/2 pint grape or currant jelly or juice
Oil of spearmint
1 package small round crackers
1 ounce marshmallow cream
1 cup salad oil
Loaf sugar



FRUIT CUP

Remove skin and seeds from
  1/2 pound white grapes. If grapes are firm, boiling water may be
poured over them and allowed to stand 1 minute, when skins will come
off easily.

Pare
  2 oranges, removing white part with the skin, and remove sections
free from membrane.

Cut
  4 slices canned pineapple in dice. Mix the fruit with
  1/3 cup sugar
  1 tablespoon lemon juice
  1/2 cup orange juice

HOT HAM SANDWICHES

Put
  1 pound cooked ham through food chopper. Add
  4 tablespoons creamed butter,
  1 teaspoon mustard and
  1 teaspoon paprika, and mix well. Cut
Bread in sixteen 1/4-inch slices, spread eight slices bread with
the ham mixture, cover with remaining bread and press slices firmly
together. Cut each sandwich in three strips. Beat
  2 eggs slightly and add
  2 cups milk. Dip sandwiches, one at a time, in this mixture, and saute
in butter, cooking on one side until browned, and then turning and
browning the other side. Serve very hot.

Other meat, or marmalade or jam may be used in sandwiches in place
of ham.

[Illustration: HOT HAM SANDWICHES]



GRAPE OR CURRANT JELLY

Wash and pick over
  Fruit. Crush in kettle one layer at a time and boil, stirring
frequently, until juice is extracted from pulp. Let drip through
double piece of cheesecloth, rinsed in cold water, over night or
till juice no longer drips. Do not squeeze. To
  1 tablespoon juice add
  1 tablespoon alcohol; stir and let stand 10 minutes. If
2/3 of the mixture is cloudy use
  2/3 cup sugar to each cup juice. If all is cloudy use equal parts
sugar and juice. (This is called the Pectin Test.) Be sure that juice
mixed with alcohol is discarded immediately. Measure remaining juice
into kettle, bring to boiling point, add required amount of sugar and
cook to 220 degrees F. or until mixture will show two distinct, firm
drops when dripped from side of spoon, or when small amount will
become firm when dropped on very cold saucer. Then skim and pour into
sterilized glasses.


_Second Extraction_

Return fruit pulp to kettle, add barely enough cold water to cover it,
bring slowly to boiling point, stirring to prevent burning on; cook
5 minutes, drain and finish as for first extraction, boiling 5 minutes
before adding the sugar.


_Third Extraction_

Proceed as for second extraction. Oftentimes the juice from second and
third extractions may be combined before being made up into jelly. By
making three extractions the amount of jelly obtainable from a given
amount of fruit may be almost doubled.



TOMATO SALAD WITH CHEESE DRESSING

Cut
  4 tomatoes in halves in such a way that they come apart in points.
Arrange each half in a nest of
  Lettuce leaves. In the center of tomato pile
  Cream cheese forced through a coarse strainer. In center of cheese
put a
Few bits of green pepper finely chopped. Serve with cheese dressing.

[Illustration: TOMATO SALAD]



CHEESE DRESSING

Mix
  2 tablespoons mayonnaise dressing with
  2 tablespoons cream cheese. Add
  1/2 teaspoon salt
  1/2 teaspoon table sauce
  1/2 teaspoon paprika and add very slowly
  1/4 cup salad oil, beating with egg beater until very thick. Add slowly
  1 1/2 tablespoons vinegar. Keep in cool place till ready to serve.

Cream cheese with Roquefort flavor is desirable in both the above
recipes, but the usual cottage or cream cheese may be used if preferred.



COCOA ICE CREAM

Mix very thoroughly
  1/2 cup dry powdered cocoa
  Few grains salt
  1 cup sugar and
  1 tablespoon cornstarch. Add slowly
  2 cups milk, scalded, and cook over boiling water 20 minutes,
stirring until thickened and occasionally afterward. Pour over
  2 eggs well beaten, chill, and add
  2 cups cream beaten stiff
  1 teaspoon vanilla and
  1 cup syrup drained from canned raspberries or strawberries, and freeze.

If frozen in a vacuum freezer, put mixture in center can of freezer;
cover, invert freezer, and fill outer compartment with finely crushed ice
mixed with half the amount of rock salt. Open the freezer occasionally,
scrape cream from sides and mix well, using a long-bladed knife. If frozen
in an ordinary freezer, it is not necessary to beat the cream. Put mixture
in can of ice cream freezer, surround with three parts ice and one
part salt.

Let mixture stand 5 minutes, then turn crank slowly until mixture is
stiff. When frozen drain off ice water and repack, using four parts
ice and one part salt.



FIG MARGUERITES

Put in top of double boiler
  7/8 cup sugar and
  3 tablespoons water. Stir until sugar is dissolved as much as possible.
There will still be small sugar crystals remaining. Wash sugar crystals
from inside of double boiler with pastry brush dipped in cold water. Add
  1 egg white, unbeaten. Place over hot water and cook, beating constantly
with egg beater for 7 to 12 minutes or until mixture will hold its shape.

Add
  1 tablespoon marshmallow cream and
  1/4 teaspoon vanilla, and fold over and over until again stiff
enough to hold its shape. Add
  1/3 cup (3) figs cut in small pieces and
  1/3 cup nut meats cut in small pieces. Pile on

Small round crackers and bake at 375 degrees F. for 10 minutes or until
delicately brown. This rule will cover 3 dozen small crackers. Should
frosting be too soft to hold its shape after adding marshmallow cream,
it may be again placed over hot water, and folded gently over and over,
until it becomes slightly granular around the edges. Remove from hot
water, and continue folding over gently until of the desired stiffness.



MARSHMALLOW FROSTING

Use above mixture with or without figs and nuts as a cake filling or
frosting. It need not be baked.



CANDIED MINT LEAVES

Wipe
  Fresh mint leaves, remove from stems and rub each leaf gently with
the finger dipped in
  Egg white slightly beaten. Mix
3 tablespoons granulated sugar with
3 drops oil of spearmint, and sift over each side of the mint leaves.
Lay close together on a cake rack covered with wax paper and leave in a
warm but not a hot place until crisp and dry. Serve in
  Tea with
  Sliced lemon and
  Loaf sugar.



TEA

Half fill a perforated tea spoon or tea ball with
  Orange Pekoe, or other preferred tea. Place in cup, add fresh
  Boiling water, until cup is two-thirds full. Remove tea spoon as soon
as tea is of the desired strength.

Two or three cups of tea can usually be made without emptying and refilling
the tea spoon.

in eighths lengthwise. Remove skins and stems from

20 minutes and strain. Melt
  1/3 cup butter, add
  1/3 cup flour mixed with
  3/4 teaspoon salt and
  1/8 teaspoon pepper. When smooth add
  Stock strained from mushroom skins, with enough
  Top milk or thin cream to make 3 cups. Stir until sauce boils. Saute
mushroom caps in
  1 tablespoon butter for 3 minutes. Add to sauce with the
  Hard cooked eggs. When thoroughly heated turn out on a platter and
arrange
  Bacon curls over the top.

  4 small cooked potatoes cut in pieces or
  1 cup cooked macaroni or
  1 small can asparagus cut in pieces may be used instead of
mushrooms.



BACON CURLS

Place thin strips of
  Bacon on a board and with a broad-bladed knife press strips out
as thin as possible. Roll each slice into a curl and fasten with a
wooden toothpick. Cook until crisp and delicately brown in hot
  Bacon fat deep enough to cover the curls of bacon.
Drain on brown paper and remove toothpicks.

Sift together
  2 cups bread flour
  5 teaspoons baking powder and
  1 teaspoon salt. With tips of fingers work in

and roll out 1/4 inch thick. Cut in oval shapes 6 inches long and 3 inches
wide with round ends. Lay on tin sheet. Make 1/2-inch cuts 1 inch from and
parallel with the ends. Put
  1 teaspoon of orange marmalade in the center.
Bring one end of dough through hole in other end. Press edges together
and bake in hot oven or at 450 degrees F. for 15 minutes. Pastry may be
used instead of baking powder biscuit dough for these turnovers.



QUICK ORANGE MARMALADE

Remove skins in quarters from
  2 oranges and
  1 lemon, close to the pulp. Break up pulp and remove seeds. Add
  1/2 cup water and simmer in covered saucepan for 45 minutes. Boil
rind from oranges and lemons with
  4 cups water in covered saucepan for 20 minutes. Drain and discard
water. With sharp-edged spoon scrape out and discard white part of skins,
leaving only yellow rind. With sharp knife shred yellow rinds just as
thin as possible in pieces about 1 inch long. Simmer shredded rinds
again in
  2 1/2 cups water in covered saucepan for 15 minutes.
Drain and discard water. Mix cooked pulp with rinds. Measure
  2 cups of mixed rind and pulp, adding water if necessary to make up
this amount. Add
  3 1/2 cups sugar and mix well. Stir constantly and bring to vigorous

Put in small saucepan
  1 1/4 cups brown sugar
  2 tablespoons butter and
  1 1/2 cup water; stir until sugar is melted and boil without stirring
to 238 degrees F. or until syrup forms a soft ball when tried in cold
water. Pour slowly onto
  3 egg yolks well beaten, and beat until cold and thick.
(This mixture may be made the day before and kept in a cool place, if
desired.) Fold in
  3 egg whites beaten stiff
  1 teaspoon vanilla
  1 1/2 cups heavy cream beaten stiff and
  1/2 cup nut meats broken in pieces. Put in paper cases, sprinkle with

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS," WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     https://www.gutenberg.org/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     https://www.gutenberg.org/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     https://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/6/8/24689
